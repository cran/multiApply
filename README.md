This package extends the apply and plyr families of functions to applications which involve the use of multiple arrays as input.

This is especially useful for climate data related applications, where data is often distributed across multiple arrays with different dimensions (e.g experimental array 1, experimental array 2 and the observations). The multiApply:Apply function reduces the need write loops for every application.
